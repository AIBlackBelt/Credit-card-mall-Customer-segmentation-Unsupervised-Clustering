This work concerns applying two unsupervised learning algorithms on a set of customer. The aim was to detect potential segment of people to target while conducting marketing activities

We used two datasets :

Mall customer dataset 
We applied OPTICS clustering (Density based clustering) on this data. The algorithm has been applied on every subset of two features in order to discover common patterns  each of these subsets
